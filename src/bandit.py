"""
Simple multiâ€‘armed bandit for rule selection.

In this prototype we use a uniform random choice among available rules.  A more
advanced implementation might use Thompson sampling or another contextual
bandit algorithm.  The class is used by the write gate to decide which of
several competing self rules to apply in a given context.
